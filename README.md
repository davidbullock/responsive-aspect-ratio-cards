Simple cards with responsive, fixed aspect ratio images. Aspect ratio is set on image container. “Object-fit: cover“ is used with images of unknown dimensions, a basic CSS only fallback is used for IE9+.

There are a couple of useful aspect ratios in the list of variables, these essentially form a fraction for the image container.

Consider object-fit polyfil solutions for IE.
